### Created a virtual machine using the RISC-V architecture:

• Developed simple monitors for tasks like single-step execution, memory scanning, register printing, and expression evaluation, took charge of the debugging process, and monitored their performances.

*•* Implemented CPU instruction execution for the RISC-V architecture, covering the base instruction set, the M extension instruction set, and the CSR operation instruction set, and established device-to-memory mapping for serial, clock, keyboard, and VGA devices.

*•* Designed system call and fundamental C library functions and developed a basic file system and multimedia libraries, allowing for the loading and execution of client programs such as Immortal Sword and Sorcery, a popular online game.

*•* Introduced time-sharing multitasking capabilities on a single-core CPU.
